### under the surface Lava runner
---
a 2d game made in Godot, I made this game as my first Godot project. The idea was simple — build a runner game set deep underground where lava is everywhere and rocks are trying to kill you. What made it interesting is that I built everything using only basic shapes and code. No downloaded images, no sprite sheets, nothing like that. Every rock, every lava glow, every stalactite dripping from the ceiling — all made with ColorRect nodes and GDScript.
It started as a basic "player jumps over boxes" prototype and slowly turned into something I'm actually proud of. :)
